# VTT_scripts
Scripts for the _Vej- og trafikdatabehandling (VTT6)_ course, installing all the needed programs and packages.

## How to run
Depending on your operative system, the files should be run differently.

On both windows and mac, it is adviced to have the anti-virus turned off, 
since most anti-virus programs won't accept non-verified installation programs,
and terminate the script.
