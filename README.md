# VTT_scripts
Scripts for the _Vej- og trafikdatabehandling (VTT6)_ course, installing all the needed programs and packages.

## How to run
Depending on your operative system, the files should be run differently.

On both windows and mac, it is adviced to have antivirus software turned off, 
since most antivirus programs won't accept non-verified installation programs,
and terminate the script.

[Download](https://github.com/TRG-BUILD/VTT6_scripts/releases/latest) the latest source code and unpack the installation files

### Windows

Go to the directory where you downloaded the file, unpack it.

**!! Make sure** there no spaces " " in your parent directory names (eg. "OneDrive - Aalborg Universitet" is forbidden).

The file _win_install.bat_ should be right-clicked and set to "run as administrator".

#### UNINSTALL

Run _win_uninstall.bat_ as administrator

### Mac OS X (tested on Big Sur)

Open your Terminal using Spotlight (âŒ˜ + space)

Goto you directory, where you downloaded the installation files.

If it is in your download folder then go to directory by entering:
```
cd ~/Downloads/unzip
VTT6_scripts-1.2.zip 
cd VTT6_scripts-1.2
```

Install by entering:
```
zsh mac_install.sh
```

The files should be self explanatory when run.

#### UNINSTALL

If you wan to uninstall on Mac OS X then run

```
zsh mac_uninstall.sh
```
