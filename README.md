# VTT_scripts
Scripts for the VTT6 course, installing all the needed programs and packages.

## How to run
Depending on your operative system, the files should be run differently.
On both windows and mac, it is adviced to have the anti-virus turned off, 
since most anti-virus programs won't accept non-verified installation programs,
and terminate the script. (for a good reason!)

On windows, the file should be right-clicked and set to "run as administrator".

On mac, one can right click on the file and choose "open location in terminal" and then run the command
- chmod 755 file_name
The file should then be possible to execute through a double click.

The files should be self explanatory when run.
